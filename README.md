Demo of Futures for api requests
================================

This is a small experiment to try out/demonstrate some of the features of Futures as an altenative to resolving data from http requests. The native fetch is wrapped with Fluture, providing a lazy, cancellable api.

Technologies
----------------

- [Fluture](https://github.com/fluture-js/Fluture) - the best Futures library I have found so far
- [Sanctuary](https://sanctuary.js.org/) - a functional utilities library with excellent type checking in development
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) - lightweight replacement for React
- [Preact-emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) - a smaller, faster replacement for styled-components
- [Unistore](https://github.com/developit/unistore) - a tiny redux lib state management lib (the version here is slightly modified)
